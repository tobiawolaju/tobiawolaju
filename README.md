# Tobi Awolaju
### Systems Engineer | Web3 Infrastructure & Applied ML

I build high-performance decentralized systems, focusing on EVM observability, high-concurrency environments, and browser-native AI inference. My work bridges the gap between low-level execution traces and real-time user experiences.

## Tinkering
| Project | Technical Innovation | Tech Stack | Status |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **[WorldOfNads](https://github.com/tobiawolaju/WorldOfNads)** | High-concurrency arena engine utilizing Monad for trustless settlement with real-time off-chain sync. | Monad, WebSockets, Node.js | **Active** |
| **[Monad Execution Indexer](https://github.com/tobiawolaju/Monad-Execution-Trace-Indexer)** | Reorg-aware ingestion for opcode-level traces; providing deep observability for high-throughput chains. | Rust, EVM Tracing, Postgres | **Ongoing** |
| **[IF-Then](https://github.com/tobiawolaju/if-then)** | Decision-consequence simulator featuring natural language routing queries and Google Calendar sync. | TypeScript, ML, API Integrations | **Ongoing** |
| **[Citadel](https://github.com/tobiawolaju/citadel):** | A persistent, hybrid environment for autonomous AI agents operating across on-chain and off-chain layers. (Researching agentic EVM interactions) | TypeScript, ML, API Integrations | **Ongoing** |
| **[LogicGateAIModel](https://github.com/tobiawolaju/LogicGateAIModel):** | Browser-native neural network for conditional logic, optimized for zero-server inference via ONNX.
* **Full-Stack Capabilities:** I build from the metal up—handling everything from EVM opcodes and Rust backends to frontend 2D/3D art assets. | TypeScript, ML, API Integrations | **Ongoing** |
