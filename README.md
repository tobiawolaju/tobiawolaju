# Tobi Awolaju  
**Systems Engineer building real-time intelligent machines and infrastructure**

I design and build end-to-end systems that operate under real-world constraints — from perception and control in embodied robots to high-throughput, low-latency blockchain infrastructure.

My work sits at the intersection of **robotics, AI, and distributed systems**, with a focus on scalability, reliability, and asymmetric performance gains.
