### Full-Stack Web3 Dev | Smart Contracts | Tooling | Privacy-Preserving Systems
I build end-to-end web3 products: from Solidity smart contracts to React frontends, backend services, and blockchain tooling. My work spans protocol-level indexing, trading automation, NFT aggregation, privacy-preserving voting, multiplayer games, and developer education.
