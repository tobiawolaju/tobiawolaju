# Tobi Awolaju
### Systems Engineer | Web3 Infrastructure & Applied ML

I build high-performance decentralized systems, focusing on EVM observability, high-concurrency environments, and browser-native AI inference. My work bridges the gap between low-level execution traces and real-time user experiences.

## 🔬 Systems & ML Experiments

* **[Citadel](https://github.com/tobiawolaju/citadel):** A persistent, hybrid environment for autonomous AI agents operating across on-chain and off-chain layers. (Researching agentic EVM interactions).
* **[LogicGateAIModel](https://github.com/tobiawolaju/LogicGateAIModel):** Browser-native neural network for conditional logic, optimized for zero-server inference via ONNX.
* **Full-Stack Capabilities:** I build from the metal up—handling everything from EVM opcodes and Rust backends to frontend 2D/3D art assets.
