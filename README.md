## About Me
I am a systems thinker and full-stack Web3 engineer with a background in Electrical & Electronics Engineering. I design end-to-end systems that span:

- **Blockchain & Web3:** Smart contracts, protocol-level tooling, NFT aggregation, VRF-based multiplayer games  
- **Real-Time Systems & Robotics:** Embedded control, SLAM, perception, and high-DOF actuation  
- **Backend & Tooling:** Indexers, trading bots, analytics dashboards, event-driven automation  
- **Frontend & UX:** React/Three.js/WebAssembly interfaces for games and dashboards  

I specialize in building **hybrid systems** that integrate off-chain performance with on-chain security and reliability.
